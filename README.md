Spell Master Game
Spell Master is a two-player game where wizards battle by casting spells, adhering to specific rules to outwit their opponents.

Game Description
Players take turns choosing spells from a provided list. A spell must be more powerful than the previous one based on certain conditions: it must not have been used before and should begin with the last character of the opponent's previous spell.

Rules
1. Spells chosen must be from the provided list.
2. No repetition of spells is allowed.
3. Each spell's first character must match the last character of the opponent's previous spell.
4. A player wins if their opponent fails to meet these conditions.

Project Phases

Phase One
1. Implement a two-player version of Spell Master.
2. Read spells from 'spells.txt'.
3. Prompt players for their names and display the list of available spells.
4. Determine the starting player randomly.
5. Players take turns choosing spells until a winner emerges.
6. No ties are allowed.

Phase Two
1. Implement a bot to play Spell Master.
2. One player will be the bot.
3. The program functions similarly to Phase One, but the bot generates moves.
4. The bot's strategy should outperform random selection.

Bonus
1. Implement different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) for the bot.
2. Each level should offer distinct strategies, all outperforming random moves.

Implementation Details
1. The program is written in C.
2. Two phases focus on creating a functional game and enhancing the bot's intelligence.
3. The code is uploaded to the 'src' directory.
Specifications and test cases used for validation are documented in 'Specifications & Test Cases.txt'.

Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare 'spells.txt' with the spell list.
3. Run the program to play Spell Master.
